Calculate the energy 
Print the result


Stage 2

Ask user to enter initial temperature
Collect the initial temperature
Store the initial temperature as initialtemperature
Ask user to enter final temperature
Collect the final temperature
Store the initial temperature as finaltemperature
Ask user to enter amount of water in kilogram
Collect the initial mass of water
Store the mass of water as massOfWater
Calculate the energy needed using 
Q = massOfWater * (finaltemperature - initialtemperature)
Store the result in energyNeeded
