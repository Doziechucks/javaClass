Stage 1
Collect velocity
Collect acceleration
Solve for the runway length 
Display result

Stage 2
Ask user to enter velocity
Collect the velocity from user 
Store the velocity as planeVelocity
Ask user to enter acceleration
Collect the Acceleration from user 
Store the velocity as planeAcceleration
Calculate Runway length using (planeVelocity * planeVelocity) / (2 * planeAcceleration)
Store in a variable runwayLength
And display the result
